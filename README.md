# Counter App

An interactive visual counter built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools — just open the file and go.

## Features

- **Increment** — press `+` to count up
- **Decrement** — press `−` to count down (floors at 0)
- **Reset** — returns the counter to 0
- Bounce animation on every state change
- Playful gradient background with responsive layout
